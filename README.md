# Language Learner

Language Learner is a tool designed to assist an intermediate student in pronunciation and grammar skills. Through our flashcard tools a student can hear the pronunciation of a word, it's definition and part of speech. Within the grammar component a student can fix questions scraped from language tools across the web and recieve live corrections, scores and feedback.
